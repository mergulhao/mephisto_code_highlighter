Better Code Highlighter Macro and Helper For Mephisto
-----------------------------------------------------

A small plugin that provides a filter to wrap code that will then be picked up by dp.SyntaxHighlighter(http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) for client side highlighting and one Liquid Helper to add required stylesheets/javascripts into your layout.

The suggestion sent by mhavila(http://www.mhavila.com/syntax_test.html) to make the syntax be an valid strict html are been used. See this link for details:
http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/issues/detail?id=25

Usage
-----

Ensure the assets were copied to public folder. After this, add the code_highlighter helper into your layout. For one language support use:

  {{ 'ruby' | code_highlighter }}
  
For two languages support use:
  
  {{ 'ruby' | code_highlighter: 'java' }}
  
For three or more languages, use:

  {{ 'ruby' | code_highlighter: 'java', 'cpp' }}

And so on. I know it's ugly, but I don't know another way to send multiple arguments to a Liquid filter. If you know, please tell me how!

Valid languages are: cpp, csharp, css, delphi, java, javascript, php, python, ruby, sql, vb and xml.

Then in your posts do:

<filter:jscode lang="javascript">
  document.someScriptThing = "BOO"
</filter:jscode>
